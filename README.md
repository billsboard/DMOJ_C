# DMOJ_C

This repository houses solutions for DMOJ problems. Problems will be organized by their problem code. For example, the problem with code `ccc00j1`
refers to the problem at www.dmoj.ca/problem/ccc01j1.

Code in this repository will be written in C or C++.

Note that some problems here may not actually be functional

**A note on problem names:
  Problems with multiple solutions will be suffixed with `_solutiontype`. For example, a problem with a secondary brute-force solution would be noted as `problemcode_bf`
